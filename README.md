✈️ Flight Fare Analysis and Price Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing flight ticket prices to identify key factors that influence airfare and to support price prediction using data analytics techniques. A cleaned flight dataset was used to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes trends, correlations, and patterns in flight pricing based on travel time, route, and number of stops.

🎯 Objectives

To analyze flight fare variations across different routes and travel periods.

To identify trends and correlations affecting ticket prices.

To visualize pricing behavior using an interactive dashboard.

To support informed decision-making for travelers and airlines.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains flight booking records with attributes such as:

Airline

Source city

Destination city

Route

Number of stops

Journey date (day and month)

Ticket price

After cleaning and preprocessing, the dataset was used for analytical modeling and dashboard creation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – Data cleaning and preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data analysis and visualization

📊 Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Average, minimum, and maximum ticket prices

Price trends by month

Price comparison by number of stops

Day-of-week vs price analysis

Route-based and source-destination analysis

Interactive slicers for airline and route filtering

📈 Types of Analysis

Descriptive Analysis: Summarizes flight price distribution and key metrics.

Diagnostic Analysis: Identifies reasons for price variation across routes, stops, and time periods.

Predictive Analysis: Helps estimate future ticket prices based on observed trends.

Prescriptive Analysis: Provides recommendations for cost-effective travel and pricing strategies.

🔍 Key Insights

Ticket prices increase with the number of stops.

Certain routes and cities consistently show higher average fares.

Monthly trends indicate seasonal fluctuations in flight prices.

The difference between minimum and maximum prices highlights premium and peak-time travel effects.

💡 Business Impact

Helps travelers choose economical travel options.

Supports airlines and travel platforms in pricing strategy optimization.

Assists in demand forecasting and cost analysis.

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can be used to understand flight pricing behavior. By analyzing historical fare data, meaningful insights were derived that help optimize travel planning and pricing strategies.
